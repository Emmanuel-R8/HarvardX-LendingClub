# Introduction {-}

Lending Club (_LC_) is an American company listed on the New York stock exchange that provides a platform for peer-to-peer lending. Unlike banks, it does not take deposits and invest them. It is purely a matching system. Each loan is split into $25 that multiple investors can invest in. LC is remunerated by fees received from both sides. LC states that they have intermediated more than $50bln since they started operations. Further description of the company is easily available online numerous sources.

In order for investors to make the best investment decisions, LC make a historical dataset publicly available to all registered investors. This dataset is the subject of this report. It was downloaded from the Kaggle data science website^[https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data/data]. 

The size of the dataset is rich enough that it could be used to answer many different questions. We decided for a focused approach. Following Chapter 5 of [@peng2012exploratory], we will first formulate the question we want to answer to guide our analysis. 

The business model of LC is to match borrowers and investors. Naturally, more people want to receive money than part with it. An important limiting factor to LC's growth is the ability to attract investors, build a trusting relationship where, as a minimum first step, investors trust LC to provide accurate, transparent and reliable information of the borrowers. For this purpose, LC decided not only to provide extensive information about potential borrowers' profile, but also historical information about past borrowers' performance. This is, as we understand, one of the key purposes of this dataset. We decided to use the dataset for this very purpose. Essentially, the questions are: **given a borrower profile, is his/her rating appropriate in terms of risk of default? And if a default occurs, what is the expected recovery? The summary question is: given a borrower profile, is the risk/reward balance appropriate to commit funds?** In answering this question, we understand that LC allows investment of very granular amounts. Therefore, even an individual investor can diversify his/her loan and risk portfolio. It is not necessary to 'gamble' funds on a single borrower. This is exactly what institutional investors achieve through syndication (although on a very different scale, typically $10-25mln for a medium-size bank).

For this exercise, we made two simplifying (hopefully not simplistic) assumptions:

+ In determining the risk/return balance, we have not accounted for LC's cost of intermediation. By ignoring fees paid by both sides, we obviously overestimate the returns to the investors. But in first approximation, **we will assume that the risk/reward balance, from the investors' point of view, across ratings is independent from fees.** This is a simplification. Real-world fees are higher the lower the investment grade and push the investors to receive, and the borrowers to pay, higher interest margin. 

+ All-in interest rates paid by borrowers are fixed. This is highly desirable for borrowers to be able to manage their cashflow. However, an investor should always consider an investment return as a margin above a risk-free return. Banks would look at LIBOR; bond investors (e.g. life insurers) would look at government bonds. Those risk-free rates can change very quickly, whereas we understand that LC sets those rates on a less frequent basis. In other word, the risk premium will vary rapidly. **We assume that individual investors are 'in-elastic' to change in implied risk premia.** But we recognise this as a limitation of our work.
