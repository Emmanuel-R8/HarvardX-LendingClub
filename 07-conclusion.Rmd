# Conclusion

> Is the interest rate proposed by LC high enough?

> We use the entire dataset to estimate the impact of time  as a polynomial curve. To assess future loans, this would not be acceptable. Only an online algorithm should be used. For example ARMA/ARIMA, Kalman filtering of the time-trend trajectory.
