# Modelling

At the outset, the dataset presents a number of challenges:

+ There is a mix of continuous and categorical data.

+ The number of observations is very large. 

+ The possible number of predictors is fairly large.

+ As shown in the previous section, credit margins have changed over time. This is clearly related to the wider US economic environment. Financial hardship is a key driver for some of the loans. Availability of disposable income is important to assess the ability to repay. Therefore, the cost of living, which varies from state to state, seems relevant. 

Any model will require training in batch (e.g. stochastic gradient descent) or online. Our untested intuition is that online methods are not adapted to a skewed dataset: the number of defaults/write-offs is fairly low for high quality ratings.
